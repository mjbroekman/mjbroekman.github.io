# Encoding, Obfuscation, and Encryption

## What is encoding?

Encoding a term used in two different contexts.

### Character Encoding
First, there is character encoding. This is how numbers and letters are represented within the computer. The most common form of character encoding is ASCII, in which characters are stored as a single byte of data. Most of the time, your English webpages are written in ASCII, whether they are HTML, ASP, PHP, or JavaScript. Non-English webpages will also use ASCII characters if they share any characters with English, but the rest of the characters are what is called Unicode, an encoding that stores characters in 1 - 4 bytes of data, depending on where the character is in the list of Unicode characters.
