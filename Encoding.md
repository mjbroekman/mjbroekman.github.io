# Encoding, Obfuscation, and Encryption

## What is encoding?

Encoding a term used in two different contexts.

### Character Encoding
First, there is character encoding. This is how numbers and letters are represented within the computer. The most common form of character encoding is ASCII, in which characters are stored as a single byte of data. Most of the time, your English webpages are written in ASCII, whether they are HTML, ASP, PHP, or JavaScript. Non-English webpages will also use ASCII characters if they share any characters with English, but the rest of the characters are what is called Unicode, an encoding that stores characters in 1 - 4 bytes of data, depending on where the character is in the list of Unicode characters.

Encoding is simply how the characters or text are represented in a computer. Everyone is familiar with ASCII (whether they realize it or not) as the text encoding for English keyboards and the characters on them. ASCII, at it's basic level, uses 1 byte (eight ones or zeros) to represent each character. This, however, only offers 256 combinations. As such, additional _character_ encodings are needed to handle all of the different alphabets. This led to creation of the Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) which encodes characters in a way that allows for

However, if you are familiar with non-English languages and the alphabets that are used in them, you will realize that there are a lot of characters to keep track of.
