# Welcome

This folder is a repository of background information for my malware analysis videos on YouTube.

While the videos will be geared towards malware analysts, the background information presented here is useful for anyone that has ever looked at the code behind a website and thought "What the heck is that doing?"

#### Note
{:.no_toc}

While malware comes in every programming language available, the examples that I will be focusing on are the types that tend be found on websites and, as such, will mostly be in the languages listed above. When an interesting sample is in another language, however, we will still attempt to break it apart and look at what it is doing.

## Acknowledgements
Obviously, the people I've met over the years and, especially, the ones that mentored (and continue to mentor) me deserve a lot of thanks.

The inspiration for this site is, however, John Hammond ( [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnHammond) [YouTube](https://youtube.com/johnhammond010) ). I was explaining some obfuscated VBScript to some coworkers and, in the process, searched for VBScript deobfuscation tools and found John's [video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9-X_NRlJc). So, if you're looking for an engaging, knowledgeable guy, check him out along with the other creators at [securitycreators.video](https://securitycreators.video/).
