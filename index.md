# Welcome
This site is a repository of background information for my 'Moment on Malware' series of videos. This is a new endeavor, however, and still very much under construction.

While the videos will be geared towards malware analysts, the background information presented here is useful for anyone that has ever looked at the code behind a website and thought "What the heck is that doing?"

## About Me
My name is Maarten Broekman. I've been working as a system administrator and systems engineer for over 25 years, primarily in the shared web-hosting space. One of the main concerns for web-hosting providers is being able to serve up their customers websites as quickly and efficiently as possible. As a result, anything that detracts from performance needs to be examined closely and this is where my interest in malware and code analysis sprang from. For the last decade, finding, decoding, and removing malware (and automating that process) has been a formal part of my job.

Additionally, an unspoken part of my job has always been mentoring and teaching the skills I have. This website, and the videos I am producing, is the next step in bringing this part of my passion to a wider audience.

## Topics
* Terminology
  * [Encoding, Compression, and Obfuscation](Encoding.md)
  * [Encryption](Encrypting.md)
* Programming Language functions
  * [PHP](Php.md)
  * [JavaScript](JavaScript.md)
  * [VBScript / ASP](VBScript.md)
  * [Perl](Perl.md)

#### Note
While malware comes in every programming language available, the examples that I will be focusing on are the types that tend be found on websites and, as such, will mostly be in the following languages:
* [PHP](Php.md)
* [JavaScript](JavaScript.md)
* [VBScript / ASP](VBScript.md)
* [Perl](Perl.md)

Interesting samples in other languages will be shown, but the majority of the discussion will be focused on the languages that are behind some of the most popular website technologies.

#### Acknowledgements
Obviously, the people I've met over the years and, especially, the ones that mentored (and continue to mentor) me deserve a lot of thanks.

The inspiration for this site is, however, John Hammond (https://github.com/JohnHammond) (https://youtube.com/johnhammond010). I was explaining some obfuscated VBScript to some coworkers and, in the process, searched for VBScript deobfuscation tools and found John's video on the topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9-X_NRlJc). So, if you're looking for an engaging, knowledgeable guy, check him out along with the other creators at (https://securitycreators.video/).
