## About Me
My name is Maarten Broekman. I've worked as a system administrator and systems engineer for over 25 years, primarily in the shared web-hosting space. One of the main concerns for web-hosting providers is being able to serve their customersâ€™ websites as quickly and efficiently as possible. As a result, anything that detracts from performance needed to be examined closely. One of the other major concerns is being able to deploy systems (both physical and virtual) quickly and configure them properly as well as verifying that configuration. This makes automation and scripting vital to their success.

This is where my interest in malware and code analysis sprang from. For over a decade, finding, decoding, and removing malware (and automating that process) has been my primary focus alongside a passion for automated system deployment and configuration. 

An unspoken part of my job has always been mentoring and sharing the skills I have with others. This website is the next step in bringing this part of my passion to a wider audience.
