# Welcome

This site is a repository of background information for my 'Moment on Malware' series of videos. This is a new endeavor, however, and still very much under construction.

While the videos will be geared towards malware analysts, the background information presented here is useful for anyone that has ever looked at the code behind a website and thought "What the heck is that doing?"

## About Me
My name is Maarten Broekman. I've worked as a system administrator and systems engineer for over 25 years, primarily in the shared web-hosting space. One of the main concerns for web-hosting providers is being able to serve their customersâ€™ websites as quickly and efficiently as possible. As a result, anything that detracts from performance needed to be examined closely and this is where my interest in malware and code analysis sprang from. For more over a decade, finding, decoding, and removing malware (and automating that process) has been my primary focus.

An unspoken part of my job has always been mentoring and sharing the skills I have with others. This website, and the videos I am producing, is the next step in bringing this part of my passion to a wider audience.

#### Note
{:.no_toc}

While malware comes in every programming language available, the examples that I will be focusing on are the types that tend be found on websites and, as such, will mostly be in the languages listed above. When an interesting sample is in another language, however, we will still attempt to break it apart and look at what it is doing.

## Acknowledgements
Obviously, the people I've met over the years and, especially, the ones that mentored (and continue to mentor) me deserve a lot of thanks.

The inspiration for this site is, however, John Hammond ( [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnHammond) [YouTube](https://youtube.com/johnhammond010) ). I was explaining some obfuscated VBScript to some coworkers and, in the process, searched for VBScript deobfuscation tools and found John's [video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9-X_NRlJc). So, if you're looking for an engaging, knowledgeable guy, check him out along with the other creators at [securitycreators.video](https://securitycreators.video/).
