# Welcome

This site is a repository of background information for Maarten's 'Moment on Malware' series of videos. This is a new endeavor, however, and still very much under construction.

While the videos will be geared towards malware analysts, the background information presented here is useful for anyone that has ever looked at the code behind a website and thought "What the heck is that doing?"

## Topics
* Terminology
 * [Encoding, Encryption, and Obfuscation](Encoding.md)
