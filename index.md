## About Me
My name is Maarten Broekman.

I've worked as a system administrator and systems engineer for over 25 years, primarily in the shared-web-hosting and financial-services spaces. Over the course of my career, I've done a variety of jobs ranging from system adminstration to malware hunting to script development and system automation. The pages here highlight some of the work I've done in the malware hunting space as well as following my journey to learn more programming languages.

Additionally, an major part of my jobs has been mentoring and sharing the skills I have with others. After all, if I can teach someone else to do the things I do, it means I have more time to work on other things.
