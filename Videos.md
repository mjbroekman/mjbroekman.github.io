# Video List
## Malware Deconstruction
* [Finding Executable Code in GitHub JSON](https://youtu.be/XgEBOZUs0rg)
  * I found malicious code unexpectedly in the repository JSON data
* [Extracting from GitHub JSON plus Zeura Decoding](https://youtu.be/x5QIXCq6pK4)
  * A longer version of the above video which includes the decoding of a zeura-encoded file
* [Decoding an IndoTrojan Ransomware script](https://youtu.be/wND43xbWVgI)
  * Opening up, decoding, and explaining an IndoTrojan ransomware script
* [I wrote a decoder](https://youtu.be/AAnQkp48CJg)
  * This is the decoder used for 'cracking' Zeura, Sendy, and other PHPEncode obfuscated files.
* [Bitwise Operations Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB7kxbnvHVY)
  * I'll walk you through what logical (or bitwise) operators do, show how this transforms characters on a bit-by-bit basis, and then provide two real-life examples of how these are used to hide malicious code in seemingly random characters
* [Malicious Whitespace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KcI3qTC39w)
  * I walk the viewer through the functionality of the old CoreLibrariesHandler malware and show a variant that's significantly harder to detect and equally powerful.
* [(Not as) Sneaky as a Fox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwz1Nyw4laE)
  * I step through a webshell dropper that caught my attention when it was unsuccessfully injected into a honeypot...twice. The dropper performs a few interesting functions, which I talk about, and then I briefly show the webshell it attempts to install and point out the particular indicators that allowed me to conclude this was malicious without fully decoding the payload.
* [Finding the Fox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JeHgKa6vCk)
  * I walk viewers through the deconstruction of an anonymousF0x web shell, showing the complexities of debugging multi-byte files, highlighting the interesting features of the encoding and multiple layers of this particular web shell, and showing some of the functionality built into it.
* [Base64 Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHbuK4wX8xo)
  * I step through the process used to encode and decode strings in base64.
* [Adventures in PowerShell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AaMJx9Y7cU)
  * I walk viewers through a multi-stage PowerShell dropper and the two PE32 executables that it contains

## Tutorials
* [Creating Logical Signatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWS2CehT1HU)
  * Quick tutorial on making a logical signature to detect multiple Subject: headers in an email message
