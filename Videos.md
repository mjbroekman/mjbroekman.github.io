# Video List
* [Finding Executable Code in GitHub JSON](https://youtu.be/XgEBOZUs0rg)
  * I found malicious code unexpectedly in the repository JSON data
* [Extracting from GitHub JSON plus Zeura Decoding](https://youtu.be/x5QIXCq6pK4)
  * A longer version of the above video which includes the decoding of a zeura-encoded file
* [Decoding an IndoTrojan Ransomware script](https://youtu.be/wND43xbWVgI)
  * Opening up, decoding, and explaining an IndoTrojan ransomware script
* [I wrote a decoder](https://youtu.be/AAnQkp48CJg)
  * This is the decoder used for 'cracking' Zeura, Sendy, and other PHPEncode obfuscated files.
* [Bitwise Operations Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB7kxbnvHVY)
  * I'll walk you through what logical (or bitwise) operators do, show how this transforms characters on a bit-by-bit basis, and then provide two real-life examples of how these are used to hide malicious code in seemingly random characters
* [Malicious Whitespace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KcI3qTC39w)
  * I walk the viewer through the functionality of the old CoreLibrariesHandler malware and show a variant that's significantly harder to detect and equally powerful.
